# This operation has to be undone here be spinmap.jl
# expects the chemical potential hasn't been
# embedded within the hamiltonian. This behaviour can't
# be changed without changing LatticeQM because
# densitymatrix_distributed is called in spinmap and
# it is this function that ultimately makes this
# assumption. Another work around would be to add the
# chemical potential and then have spinmap assume the
# chemical potential is zero. But that manipulates state
# throughout the length of the program and I prefer this
# because it doesn't.
